YaCoCo - Yet Another Code Coverage Tool for JavaScript
======================================================

Provides inline code coverage for JavaScript more similar to
[jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage) and
[jscov](https://github.com/jakobmattsson/jscov) than
[jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).

Generates .lvoc output. Install
[lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/) with genhtml for generating a
html report. The lcov-output format is described on the
[geninfo manpage](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php)
